# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction: Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Coin

## Objectives
- Predict the prices of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Coin based on historical data.
- Compare the performance of the Linear Regression model used for both coins.
- Identify key factors that significantly affect prices, such as trading volume and market capitalization.

## Linear Regression Model Performance

### Dogecoin
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 0.00405
- **R-squared:** 0.2305

### Shiba Inu
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 7.858892e-11
- **R-squared:** 0.3499

## Advantages and Disadvantages
**Advantages:**  
- Linear Regression is a very simple and interpretable model. It provides good insights when the relationships between variables are linear.

**Disadvantages:**  
- The model does not perform as well as others due to its lower R-squared and higher MSE values, indicating that it struggles to capture the complexities of the data effectively.
